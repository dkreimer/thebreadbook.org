ANNOTATIONS - Any scary words that people might automatically think negative things about, like Anarchism or Communism, should have an annotation explaining what we mean. We should also have annotations for any historical events or movements (like Collectivism) that people might not know about. All of the annotations will be drop-down modals with information about the term, including Videos if good ones exist. 

    Anarchism/Anarchist - "Although many people are led to believe anarchism is chaotic and violent, in reality, most anarchists want a world without violence all together - a world where everybody can get along without the use of force. When Kropotkin uses the word "Anarchist", he is saying that he wants his program to be rolled out independent of government power, with the ultimate goal of abolishing it.
